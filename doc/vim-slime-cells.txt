                                                *slime-cells*
A cell management wrapper around vim-slime. Currently it allows users to
navigate between cells and provides a mapping to send current and go to next
cell.

1. Usage                                        *slime-cells-usage*

Without any configuration, the plugin does not map anything. However, the
author of the plugin likes to change a bit the configuration of |slime|
like this :
>
    " vim-slime configuration
    let g:slime_cell_delimiter = "^\\s*##"
    let g:slime_no_mappings = 1
    nmap <c-c>v <Plug>SlimeConfig
<
This configuration will tell |slime| that any line that starts with zero
or more spaces folowed by '##' marks the limit between two cells. Then we
deactivate slime's default mappings and map the configuration command.
We can then proceed to configure |slime-cells|. The commands names are pretty
self-explanatory. Check |slime-cells-configuration| for more details.
>
    " vim-slime-cells configuration
    nmap <c-c><c-c> <Plug>SlimeCellsSendAndGoToNext
    nmap <c-c><c-Down> <Plug>SlimeCellsNext
    nmap <c-c><c-Up> <Plug>SlimeCellsPrev
<

2. Highlighting                                 *slime-cells-highlight*

By default, slime-cells highlights whole line delimiting cells using a
highlight group derived from "SpecialComment". It also underlines the whole
line to mark the separation. This behaviour can be tweaked in two ways.

Changing the parent highlight group~

This is done by setting |g:slime_cells_highlight_from|, e.g.
>
   let g:slime_cells_highlight_from = "Comment"
<

Changing completely the default behaviour~

The highlight of cell boundaries is performed using the |sig| command. If you
set |g:slime_cells_no_highlight| to something different from 0, e.g.
>
   let g:slime_cells_no_highlight = 1
<
Then, the default highlightinf behaviour is disabled. You can then set-up a
completely new one, e.g.
>
    hi! link CellBoundary Comment
    autocmd TextChanged,TextChangedI,TextChangedP,BufWinEnter,BufWritePost,FileWritePost * :call slime_cells#sign_on_cell_boundaries()
<

The second line calls a function to detect the cell separation lines and place
the correct sign on them each time the text in buffer is updated.

3. Configuration                                *slime-cells-configuration*

Global variables~

                                                *g:slime_cell_delimiter*
g:slime_cell_delimiter              A regex to delimit cells. The name is
                                    "cell" and not "cells" to keep
                                    compatibility with vim-slime.

                                                *g:slime_cells_highlight_from*
g:slime_cells_highlight_from        Highlight group from which cells
                                    boundaries highlights are copied. Default
                                    is "SpecialComment".

                                                *g:slime_cells_no_highlight*
g:slime_cells_no_highlight          If set different to 0, the default 
                                    highlight mechanism is disabled. Default
                                    is 1.

Mappings~

                                                *<Plug>SlimeCellsSend*
                                                *SlimeCellsSend*
<Plug>SlimeCellsSend                Send current cell. Cells are delimited by
                                    |g:slime_cell_delimiter|.

                                                *<Plug>SlimeCellsSendAndGoToNext*
                                                *SlimeCellsSendAndGoToNext*
<Plug>SlimeCellsSendAndGoToNext     Send current cell using
                                    |<Plug>SlimeCellsSend| then triggers
                                    |<Plug>SlimeCellsNext|.

                                                *<Plug>SlimeCellsNext*
                                                *SlimeCellsNext*
<Plug>SlimeCellsNext                Move cursor to next cell.

                                                *<Plug>SlimeCellsPrev*
                                                *SlimeCellsPrev*
<Plug>SlimeCellsPrev                Move cursor to previous cell.
